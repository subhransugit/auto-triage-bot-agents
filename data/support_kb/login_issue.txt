Title: Troubleshooting Web API Login Issues

Summary:
This article helps developers troubleshoot login-related errors when accessing our Web API, including incorrect credentials, token issues, and CORS errors.

Steps to Troubleshoot:

1. **Invalid Username or Password**
   - Ensure you're using the correct case-sensitive credentials.
   - Reset your password via the Developer Portal if forgotten.
   - Ensure your account is not locked due to too many failed attempts.

2. **Missing or Expired Token**
   - All API requests must include a valid Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.
   - Tokens expire after 30 minutes of inactivity. Renew it using the `/auth/refresh` endpoint.
   - If using Postman or Swagger, verify the token is being passed in each request.

3. **CORS Policy Errors**
   - If you see a browser CORS error, ensure the frontend is registered in our Client Origin list.
   - Add the correct `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header on the server.
   - Use server-to-server authentication where CORS is not an issue.

4. **403 Forbidden**
   - Make sure the API key is active and tied to your IP or domain.
   - Verify that the user has permissions for the requested endpoint.

5. **401 Unauthorized**
   - This usually means the token is missing, expired, or malformed.
   - Ensure you're not using Basic Auth â€” only Bearer tokens are supported.

6. **Debugging Tools**
   - Enable full error logging in the Developer Console.
   - Use `curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" https://api.example.com/...` to test endpoints manually.

If the issue persists, email support@yourapi.com with your API key, timestamp, and request ID.
